# Why network records and field reality do not match in 2026

If you work in telecom ops, you know the drill. You check the system to see if a port is free, but when the tech gets to the site, the port is already taken or the equipment is missing. This is the "ghost asset" problem and it is getting worse with 5G and fiber rollouts.

### The real problems we see:

* **Inaccurate Records:** Physical hardware and digital records get out of sync within months of a new rollout.
* **Wasted Field Time:** Engineers spend too much time on site just trying to find the right fiber pair.
* **Hidden Spares:** Capex is wasted because you buy new gear for one site while perfectly good spares are sitting invisible at another.

### How to actually fix this:

Most people try to fix this with manual audits, but that data is old the moment you save it. The better way is to link your logical network paths directly to your GIS mapping. When the physical layer changes, the logical record should follow.

For anyone looking for a technical framework on how to handle this at scale, check out this **[Network Inventory Blueprint](https://www.vc4.com/modules/gis-module/)**. It covers the mapping logic needed to keep records accurate across 50 or more sites.
